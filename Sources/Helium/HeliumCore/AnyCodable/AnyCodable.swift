 A type-erased `Codable` value.

 The `AnyCodable` type forwards encoding and decoding responsibilities
 to an underlying value, hiding its specific underlying type.

 You can encode or decode mixed-type values in dictionaries
 and other collections that require `Encodable` or `Decodable` conformance
 by declaring their contained type to be `AnyCodable`.
