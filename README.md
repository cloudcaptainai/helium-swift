## **Background**

Thanks for getting started with Helium ðŸŽˆ

Helium is an upsell experimentation and optimization platform for mobile apps of all sizes. We take your appâ€™s existing paywalls and turn them into remotely editable templates that you can experiment with and optimize without waiting for new app releases.

Email founders@tryhelium.com for help/questions.


## **Installation**

Install **helium-swift** via SPM. In Xcode, go to "Add Package Dependencies", and copy in [`https://github.com/cloudcaptainai/helium-swift`](https://github.com/cloudcaptainai/helium-swift)

Set the `upToNextMajor` rule to be `2.0.8 < 3.0.0`:

## Configuration

### Set up your HeliumPaywallDelegate

To integrate Helium paywalls, create a subclass of `HeliumPaywallDelegate` or use one of our pre-built delegates. This class is responsible for handling the purchase logic for your paywalls.

```swift
public protocol HeliumPaywallDelegate: AnyObject {

    // [REQUIRED] - Trigger the purchase of a product with the following App Store Connect Product ID.
    // This method should return a HeliumPaywallTransactionStatus enum, described below.
    // Loading states/UI/UX here gets configured in the Helium dashboard, so this method should just trigger the purchase.
    func makePurchase(productId: String) async -> HeliumPaywallTransactionStatus

    // [OPTIONAL] - Restore any existing subscriptions.
    // This method should return a boolean indicating whether the restore was successful.
    // This method gets called if you've configured a CTA in the editor to restore purchases, which is recommended.
    func restorePurchases() async -> Bool

    // [OPTIONAL] Custom analytics/error logging for paywall/helium
    // related events can be added here.
    // By default, we log events to your analytics service (Amplitude, etc.), but you can override this method to add additional custom logging/handling.
    // For example, you can log failure events to a Sentry instance, or add custom alerts/notifications on certain paywall events here.
    func onHeliumPaywallEvent(event: HeliumPaywallEvent)
}
```

HeliumPaywallTransactionStatus is an enum that defines the possible states of a paywall transaction.

```swift
import Helium

public enum HeliumPaywallTransactionStatus {
    // if the subscription succeeded
    case purchased
    
    // if the subscription was cancelled
    case cancelled
    
    // if the subscription was abandoned
    case abandoned
    
    // if the subscription failed. Pass in the error as an argument for both logging and downstream handling.
    case failed(Error)
    
    // if the user restored their subscription
    case restored
    
    // if the subscription is 'pending' (requires action from developer)
    case pending
}
```

### Example Delegates:

#### StoreKit 2

Use the StoreKitDelegate to handle purchases using native StoreKit 2:

```swift
import Helium

let delegate = StoreKitDelegate(productIds: [
    "<product-id-1>",
    "<product-id-2>",
])
```

If you would like to implement `onHeliumPaywallEvent`, simply create a subclass of StoreKitDelegate.

#### RevenueCat

```swift
import HeliumRevenueCat

let delegate = RevenueCatDelegate(entitlementId: "<revenue-cat-entitlement-id>")
```

If you would like to implement `onHeliumPaywallEvent`, simply create a subclass of RevenueCatDelegate. Make sure to initialize RevenueCat before initializing Helium or alternatively you can supply your RevenueCat API key to RevenueCatDelegate() and have Helium initialize RevenueCat for you.

### Initialize Helium and Download Paywall Configs

Somewhere in your app's initialization code (e.g. your `main App` if using SwiftUI, or `AppDelegate` if using ViewController), add the following line to actually download paywall config/variants.

_We schedule it on a background thread, so you don't have to worry about it blocking your app's launch time. Helium will automatically retry downloads as needed for up to 90 seconds._

```swift
Helium.shared.initialize(
    // you'll get this from Helium founders during setup!
    apiKey: "<your-helium-api-key>",
        
    // The delegate you created earlier.
    heliumPaywallDelegate: YourHeliumPaywallDelegate(),

    // Defines a fallback paywall to show in case the user's device is not connected to the internet.
    fallbackView: (any View)? = nil,

    // If set, a custom user id to use instead of Helium's. (e.g. an amplitude user id, or a custom user id from your own analytics service)
    customUserId: String? = nil

    // Pass in custom user traits to be used for targeting, personalization, and dynamic content.
    customUserTraits: HeliumUserTraits? = nil,

    // RevenueCat ONLY: supply RevenueCat appUserID here (and initialize RevenueCat before Helium initialize).
    revenueCatAppUserId: String? = Purchases.shared.appUserID,
)
```

#### Passing in Custom User Traits

HeliumUserTraits is a struct that defines the possible user traits that can be passed in. It can be created with any dictionary, as long as the key is a string and the value is a `Codable` type.

```swift
let customUserTraits = HeliumUserTraits(traits: [
    "account_age": 100,
    "subscription_status": "active",
    "user_intent": "upgrade",
])
```

#### Passing in a Custom User ID

By default, Helium generates a UUID per app session and identifies each user \+ interaction with this. You can pass override this value with a custom user id (e.g. from a 3rd party analytics service)
by passing it in as a parameter in `Helium.shared.initializeAndFetchVariants`, or by explicitly calling `Helium.shared.overrideUserId`:

```swift
// Somewhere BEFORE initialize:
Helium.shared.overrideUserId(newUserId: '<your-custom-user-id>');
```

#### Checking Download Status

After the initialization code above runs, you can check the status of the paywall configuration download using the `Helium.shared.downloadStatus()` method. This method returns a value of type `HeliumFetchedConfigStatus`, which is defined as follows:

```swift
public enum HeliumFetchedConfigStatus: Codable {
    case notDownloadedYet
    case downloadSuccess(fetchedConfigId: UUID)
    case downloadFailure
}
```

`notDownloadedYet`: Indicates that the download has not been initiated or is still in progress.

`downloadSuccess(fetchedConfigId: UUID)`: Indicates a successful download. The returned `fetchedConfigID` provides the UUID of the fetched configuration.

`downloadFailure`: Indicates that the download attempt failed.

You can use this to handle different states in your app, for example:

```swift
switch Helium.shared.downloadStatus() {
    case .notDownloadedYet:
        print("Download not started or in progress")
    case .downloadSuccess(let configId):
        print("Download successful with config ID: \(configId)")
    case .downloadFailure:
        print("Download failed")
}
```

## Presenting Paywalls

Now, anywhere in your iOS app, you can use the `triggerUpsell` modifier to (conditionally) trigger a Helium paywall\!

- You don't actually specify the paywall version name here - we load the paywall from the backend based on the trigger.
- What _is_ specified is a "trigger name". These trigger names should be **unique** across your app. User interactions with paywalls will be tracked and used to optimize the paywall for each trigger.

### Via SwiftUI ViewModifier

You can use the `.triggerUpsell` view modifier from any SwiftUI view. It can be provided with a boolean binding var parameter to control the visibility of the paywall.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State var isPresented: Bool = false
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Button {
                isPresented = true;
            } label: {
                Text("Show paywall")
            }

        }.triggerUpsell(isPresented: $isPresented, trigger: "showPaywallPress")
    }
}
```

### Via Programmatic invokation (UIKit/ViewController)

In addition to using the triggerUpsell modifier, you can also present upsells programmatically using the `presentUpsell(trigger:)` method. This is particularly useful when you need to show a paywall in response to a specific action or event in your app.

```swift
Button("Try Premium") {
    Helium.shared.presentUpsell(trigger: "postOnboardingButtonPress")
}
```

### Explicitly getting the Helium Paywall View

You can also explicitly get the Helium paywall view via `Helium.shared.upsellViewForTrigger`. This method takes a trigger and returns the paywall
as an `AnyView`.

```swift
let heliumView: AnyView = Helium.shared.upsellViewForTrigger(trigger: "postOnboardingButtonPress")
```

### Custom dismissal/navigation actions

By default, Helium uses a `DismissAction` to support dismissing the paywall. However, in cases where you want to control dismissal yourself (e.g. if you're using a custom ViewController, or a NavigationStack),
you can use `HeliumPaywallDelegate` to wire up dismissal (or any custom action\!) events from a given paywall.

To wire up actions, implement the `onCTAPressed` method as follows:

```swift

class YourHeliumPaywallDelegate: HeliumPaywallDelegate {
    
    func onHeliumPaywallEvent(event: HeliumPaywallEvent) {
        switch (event) {
            case .ctaPressed(let ctaName, let triggerName, let paywallTemplateName): {
                if (ctaName == 'dismiss') {
                    // your custom dismissal action for this trigger
                }
            }
            ... other cases
        }
    }    

    // ...rest of your methods
}
```

How it works is that any component (e.g. an X out icon, decline text, etc.) can be remotely configured to be a wrapped in a `Button` with a name. When this button component
is tapped, we fire the delegate's `onCTAPressed` method with the button name. So, once you've implemented custom swift code from your delegate, you can remotely configure
components in the paywall to trigger those methods.

## Testing

Docs here coming soon\! After integration, please message us directly to get set up with a test app \+ in-app test support.

Triggered when there's an error downloading paywall configurations.

- `error`: A string describing the error that occurred during download.

---

Note: For all events related to subscriptions and paywall interactions, the following parameters are consistently used:

- `productKey`: Identifies the specific product or subscription tier.
- `triggerName`: Indicates what caused the paywall to be displayed.
- `paywallTemplateName`: Specifies which paywall design template is being used.
